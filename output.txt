Q. What are your conclusions about the relative advantages and disadvantages of the two implementations?

Ans- Looking at the running time statistics, it seems like Linked-list based implementation is much more faster for deleting nodes (i.e. cities). It took 14 milliseconds to delete a City node from LCityDB compared to 24 seconds in ACityDB. Since inserting and deleting are similar looking operations for arrays and linked-lists, linked-list implementation should have faster execution for insertion too. This is not the case for this specific implementation as 'insert' method for ACityDB here is similar to 'append' method i.e we are just adding the inserted City object to the end of the array. 

Q. Would storing records on the list in alphabetical order by city name speed any of the operations?
Q. Would keeping the list in alphabetical order slow any of the operations?

Ans- Storing records on the list in alphabetical order will open opportunities to improve the code. For example, if records are sorted alphabetically, we can use binary search for arrays (use the middle point of arrays and keep recursing until we find the City). This will improve the speed of 'search' for array based implementation. On the downside, this would slow down the insert operation as we would have to go through the array O(n) just to sort the list into alphabetical order.
